The equipement you take with you is a very important part of the
preparation.  You can find my gear list as
[org file](/data/hrp/gear.org) or as plain [html](/data/hrp/gear.html)
here.  All the weight are given in grams. You will find some strange
notation that is used by orgmode to calculate the sums of weights.

This article is seperated into two parts.  In the first part I will
talk about some general considerations.  In the second part I will go
through my gear list and give some comments where it seems
appropriate.


# General Considerations

Regarding equipement you can once again find interesting information
at the blog of Andrew Skurka who also published a book on that matter.
Of course there are also lots of other helpful information on the web.
The gear you take with you will depends on the way you want to do the
trip.  It will make a difference if you sleep in stuffed huts or use
your tent every night.  I didn't use stuffed huts, instead I slept in
the tent or used unsfuffed huts.

Let's start with the most important part: Keep your pack as light as
possible! Weight makes a huge difference.  During the tour I realized
that it is easier for me to walk faster and carry less food just to
save some weight.  As you can see in my gear list I had a base weight
of about 9.5kg.  This was the weight of the equipement I didn't wear
on the body without food, water and fuel.  The main problem with
equipement weight is to find a good tradeoff between weight and
comfort without compromising your safety.

The next thing I found difficult was to find out how much clothing I
will need and how cold it will get at night.  Every advice on this
topic can backfire since the weather and temperature can vary alot
between different years.  When I have been there in 2015 I had lots of
sunshine and hot weather.  The first two week I saw almost no clouds
and had only one evening and night of slight rain.  In the later parts
of the pyerenees I often had rain or storms in the afternoon but
that's normal for these regions of the pyreneees.  I had two nights
where it was about freezing.  Those two night were not too comfortable
but no big problem.

I did however meet some people who tried to do the GR10 in 2014 a year
with cold weather and lots of snow even on heights much lower than the
HRP.  So be careful with my recommendations.  It worked out well for
me but you should try to find out if it is a particular hot or cold
year.


# My Equipement

I will just give some comments regarding my equipement if something
was particular good or bad.

Clothes:

- Use merino wool socks.  I had another pair of synthetic socks since
  I were told they would dry faster.  I can't confirm that but I know
  they stink alot more.
- My shoes were not quite up to the task but I have seen much heavier
  boots break in terrible ways.
- The sunshade hoody was one of the best peaces of equipement I had
  with me.  Helped me alot against burning sun.
- I have never used trekking poles before the trip but I am totally
  convinced.
- Some means of altitude measure is highly recommended.  I used a
  watch for this purpose.
- I recommend hat and gloves against cold weather.
- For me gaiters were useless.
- Luckily I could not really test the rain equipement.

Shelter and Sleeping:

- I you intend to sleep in unstuffed huts bring some sort of
  groundsheet against the dirt.  Tyvek worked perfectly.
- My sleeping bag had a comfort temperature of 4Â°C. Combined with a
  sleeping bag inlet and all my clothes for cold nights it worked out
  but I had some nights that were not too comfortable.
- Hopefully I will write a short review of the tarptent protrail soon.
  A great tent for this weight.
- Good inflatable sleeping pads are definitely more comfortable. The
  thing I like about noninflatable sleeping pads is that you can lay
  down everywhere without risking holes. I cut my pad in two parts and
  used the large one only for the night or longer rests and the short
  one all the time when I wanted to sit down.

Cooking & Water:

- I liked my pot.  Could be too small for some of you and I read that
  wider pots should be more fuel efficient.  But still: I like it.
- Aquaventure purification is good.
- The stove could be lighter but I couldn't get the hang of those
  selfmade alcohol stoves.

Navigation:

- Regarding the guidebook see [preparations article]({{< relref
  "preparations.md" >}}).

Small Essentials

- Take ear plugs with you!  You will find annoying cattle with large
  bells and loud spanish people ;).
- I had to take a towel with me since I read the hitchhikers guide to
  the galaxy. 20 grams was well worth it.
- I forgot to bring some gaffer tape.
- I can't say anything regarding blisters stuff since I never get
  blisters.
- My camera and notebook were quite heavy but I like to take pictures
  and write a journey diary.

Packing:

- Good backpack.
- Zipper bags break after about two weeks.
- I collected quite a collection of garbage sacks for rain
  protection. They get holes after some weeks.  I am not sold on those
  but outside pack layers also have their problems.


That was all about my equipement.  If you have any questions feel free
to write me an email.  Try to let it not look like spam since my
spam filter is quite active.
