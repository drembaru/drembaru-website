This post is about some early preparations or things to look out for.
If you decide to do the hrp you have to buy a guidebook.  It makes
sense to buy it early and read through the introduction and some
stages in order to get a feeling for the book.  The other part I will
cover here are the maps since it was not easy for me to decide which
maps to take since some were out of order.

A general overview over the equipement I took with me can be found
[here]({{< relref "gear-list.md" >}}).


# Guidebook

This post contains some useful information regarding the preparation
of the tour.  For me the main difficulty was finding the right
equipement and deciding which maps to take with me.  My first step
toward preparing this trip was buying a guide book.  I decided to buy
the guido from Joosten and I think that it is accurate and precise for
most parts of the walk.  Unfortunately the maps within the book are
quite poor compared to a french guidebook I have seen.  But I will
come to maps later.

The quality of Joosten's guidebook is quite high.  Unfortunately this
leads to a quite heavy little book of 380g.  Printing the relevant
pages, eight pages per side, leads to 150g.  It is worth considering
buying and printing the relevant pages from an ebook and throwing away
the parts you have already done during the trip.  This also makes
sense if you are traveling with the real guidebook.

You will find some small mistakes or inaccuracies in the book.  Most
are obvious and not worth mentioning since you won't turn left if you
have to go east but left means walking west ;).  Two things worth
mentioning:

- At pic d'Orhy "leave the ridge on the left" means going down on the
  left and not keeping the ridge on the left. Seems obvious here but I
  met some native english speakers who misread this while climbing the
  ridge.

- Joosten already mentions that the supermarket in Candanchu could be
  closed (or nonexistent).  When I was there this was the case so you
  too should expect to find nothing there.
- Refuge de Barroude doesn't exist anymore (or at least it didn't in
  2015).  It got destroyed in the winter and I heard that they won't
  rebuild it.  When I was there I met two Franch officials who were
  erasing the signpost pointing to the refuge.  Since I was one of the
  last persons reading this sign I took a picture.

# Maps

In the year I did the hike some maps where not simply not available if
you were not willing to pay 90 euros on ebay.  Besides that I didn't
want to buy all the maps in order to save some money since they have
quite some overlap.  It worked out for me but I surely don't recommend
doing that.  I had a gps in case of problems (used it once) and took
pictures of maps from other hikers.  The maps I used where:

- Carte de Randonnées N2: Pays Basque Est
- Carte de Randonnées N3: Béarn
- Mapa Excursionista N23: Aneto - Posets
- Carte de Randonnées N8: Cerdagne-Capcir
- IGN Top 100 N173: St. Gaudens Andorre

The first four maps have the scale 1:50000 and were great.  But the
last map is only 1:100000 and has no details on the spanish side
(where you are walking).  I cut away all unnecessary peaces and
painted the HRP and some details into the last map.  For the days
where I had no map I printed some openstreetmap maps but they were not
too helpful ;).

The last few days I had no maps at all but it was not difficult to
find the way since it followed GR10 for most parts.  Once again I do
recommend to buy all the maps you need.  Especially in the higher
parts you should have good maps since mistakes could lead to
exhausting detours.

It also makes sense to buy an overview map of the pyrenees.  You can
use it to mark the stages of the HRP and leave it at home for people
who care about you.
