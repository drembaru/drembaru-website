Until now I only wrote articles regarding preparations for the HRP.
That's a good thing for if you plan to do the HRP yourselft but for my
friends it's not so interesting.  So I decided to write some small
articles where I just talk about my journey and show some pictures.
Besides this overview article your reading right now I plan on doing
five articles following the five sections from the guidebook of
Joosten:

- Hendaye to Lescun
- Lescun to Gavarnie
- Gavarnie to Salardu
- Salardu to L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre
- L'Hospitalet to Banyuls-sur-Mer

## The HRP on the whole

The HRP crosses the whole pyrenees from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Mediterranean Sea.  The whole tour has a length of about 800km and
more than 40km of elevation change.  It goes through France, Spain and
Andorra, most of the time it stays close to the French-Spanish border.
It is not the only way crossing the whole pyreenes.  There are also
the long distance walks GR10 in France and GR11 in Spain.  There are
however some major differences between those and the HRP:

- The HRP crosses the border quite frequently and stays in higher and
  more remote areas of the pyrenees.  Remote means you have to carry
  food for several days and you will need a tent or do some long walks
  to reach the next hut.  You will however meet people every day if
  you walk in the main season.
- The HRP is not waymarked.  Of course it follows other trails along
  the way so you will have marks from time to time.  But sometimes you
  will only have cairns or nothing at all.
- There exist lots of different variations of the HRP.  The original
  trail introduced by Véron is not the same as Joostens and there
  exist lots of vrariations.
- You will meet much less hikers doing the same trip as you.  From
  times to times you follow one of the GRs and there you will see
  considerably more traffic.  Obviously that can be both an advantage
  or a disadvantage.

For me this was my first real long distance hike.  I did a small part
of Santiago de Camino a few years before the HRP where I crossed the
pyerenees the short way (from Oloron-Sainte-Marie to Jaca or a few
days more).  But that is an entirely different experience since I
slept in huts every night and since I haven't been traveling alone.

One of the most common question I get asked is: Why are you doing the
HRP?  Despite the fact that I tried to answer this question several
times I'm still not shure what to say.  I guess it's a combination of
different things:

- I like the simplicity. On long distance walks there are still lots
  of decisions to make but you get immediate feedback.  By the end of
  the day you will know if you took enough water with you.
- The challenge was another motivation.  It was interesting to start a
  journey without knowing if I could reach the end.  I do lots of
  sports mainly ultimate frisbee and climbing but I couldn't be sure
  if that would carry me through the whole pyerenees.
- Being close to nature and the views you get on the trip was another
  motivation.  Instead of talking about this point I'm going to show
  you some pictures in the next posts.
