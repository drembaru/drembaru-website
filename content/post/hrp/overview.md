Until now I only wrote articles regarding preparations for the HRP.
That's a good thing for if you plan to do the HRP yourselft but for my
friends it's not so interesting.  So I decided to write some small
articles where I just talk about my journey and show some pictures.
Besides this overview article your reading right now I plan on doing
five articles following the five sections from the guidebook of
Joosten:

- Hendaye to Lescun
- Lescun to Gavarnie
- Gavarnie to Salardu
- Salardu to L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre
- L'Hospitalet to Banyuls-sur-Mer

## The HRP on the whole

The HRP crosses the whole pyrenees from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Mediterranean Sea.  The whole tour has a length of about 800km and
more than 40km of elevation change.  It goes through France, Spain and
Andorra, most of the time it stays close to the French-Spanish border.
It is not the only way crossing the whole pyreenes.  There are also
the long distance walks GR10 in France and GR11 in Spain.  There are
however some major differences between those and the HRP:

- The HRP crosses the border quite frequently and stays in higher and
  more remote areas of the pyrenees.  Remote means you have to carry
  food for several days and you will need a tent or do some long walks
  to reach the next hut.  You will however meet people every day if
  you walk in the main season.
- The HRP is not waymarked.  Of course it follows other trails along
  the way so you will have marks from time to time.  But sometimes you
  will only have cairns or nothing at all.
- There exist lots of different variations of the HRP.  The original
  trail introduced by Véron is not the same as Joostens and there
  exist lots of vrariations.
