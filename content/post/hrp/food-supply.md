First of all I am definitely no expert on food for hiking trips.  I
read some blog posts from Andrew Skurka and can only recommend doing
that.  He recently published a small pdf about this subject and I
guess that is a more reliable source than this website ;).
Nonetheless I will describe my experiences here.

This article will be divided in three parts.  The first part describes
the situation in the pyrenees what possibilities you have and how
supermarkets look like.  In the second part I present my approach on
avoiding starving.  In the last part I will tell you what I would do
different the next time I did this walk.


## Pyrenees - Money or the hard Way

You will come along many stuffed huts where you can buy food if you
have the money.  Since many huts get their supplies from helicopters
food can be quite expensive.  I you want to run on a lower budget or
if you think it is a good experience to carry your food you have to
use the occasional supermarket along the way.

The supermarkets are quite small but you can usually find what you
need.  Normally you can find fruits, vegetables, cheese, other milk
products, bread, some meat, nuts, dried fruits, conserved food, soups,
some sort of cereals, sweats, cereal bars, couscous, polenta and so
on.  In Spain I had problems finding nuts without salt and real
cereals made of oat, nuts, etc and the variety of soups was not that
great.  You can often find campinggaz catridges and methylated spirit
('alcol a bruler').

Some important notes:

- Shops are usually closed on sundays.
- The shop in Candanchu was closed when I got there. In this case
  you have to walk to Canfranc Estacion. Just follow the shell of
  Saint Jacques.
- The shop in L'Hospitalet-près-l'Andorre is tiny.

All in all I was more happy in French supermarkets but I guess my
opinion is biased since I can speak French but no Spanisch ;).
Besides supermarkets you will sometimes have the opportunity to buy
cheese along the way.  One special recommendation: In France you can
sometimes find 'bananes séchées'. Try them!


## How I avoided Starving

I bought an omelette in a hut once but besides that I only used
supermarkets.  This means that I had to carry food for several days
resulting in quite some weight.  I am vegetarian and didn't make an
exception for this trip.  Besides that I try to avoid eating anything
with sugar. I managed to do that in the first half of the trip.  After
that I had to buy food in Spain and had to change this habbit.

One more general advice: If you don't have any experience with hiking
food you should use the beginning of the tour to find out what kind
and how much food you need. Here is what I did:


- I bought about 600g of food per day.  I took the guide book to find
  out how many days it will take to reach the next supermarket but I
  was usually a few days faster.  When it was obvious that I would be
  faster than the guide book told me I just ate the spare food so
  actually had a bit more than 600g/day.
- For the first two days I bought weight inefficient food like
  baguette, cheese, fruits.
- The remaining days I had oats or some kind of cereals for breakfast,
  nuts and dried fruits over the day and in the evening a soup with
  couscous or polenta and garlic.
- In towns I usually ate as much as I could focusing on proteins, fat
  and fruits.

- I took salt with me for the evening and I sometimes had salted nuts.
- I really enjoyed to have a good tea every day.  Prepare that before
  the tour so you can bring a nice mix instead of having the same tea
  every day.
- Wraps and onions are also a great combination.
- Buy food you like to eat!

## Next time I will do even better

What would I do different if I made the same tour once again? Main
problems were, that I didn't eat enough proteins and fat.  Next time I
will have a small bottle filled with olive oil and bring some protein
powder.  Besides that I did quite well with my food choice but a bit
more variety can't hurt.  And I will definitely do more research
before my next trip in order to see what I could improve.
