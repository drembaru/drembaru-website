In 2015 I did the HRP (haute randonn√©e pyreneenne) through the
pyrenees from the atlantic ocean to the mediterranean sea.  Since I
was happy for every bit of information I could find in the internet
before the trip I will share my experiences here.  I will keep it
short and focus on important things and details I had to learn on my
way or before.  Hopefully this will help some other hikers who
attempt to do this great walk.

This website is still under construction.  It should work but it will
take some time before I add more content.

This website was created using [hugo](http://gohugo.io) and the
[vienna theme](https://github.com/keichi/vienna).
